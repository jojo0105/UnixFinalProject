## Setting up the Nginx
We started off by installing **nginx** on the VPS. 
Once installed, we checked and made sure if the server was running with systemctl commands. 
After we open the website on browser to see if it also works on the web.
## Configure our website with Nginx
We made a directory for our team website. The path is called **"/var/www/html"** where you are suppose to make the directory. Afterwards, we tranferred all the files including html files and css files, and a few images into that directory.z
